Okey so using Swamp 7 is really simple. 
Just add the textures you want to be your floor and ceiling textures in the textures folder and run the executable. 
Then type 't' when it prompts you to type t or r. 
Then give it the name of the texures WITHOUT a path or file extension. Here is an example

Input name of FLOOR texture (NOT CEILING): floor_texture              <- notice how I don't provide a path or file extension

thats because of this line of code: 
self.floor_tex = pg.image.load(f'textures/{floor_text}.png').convert()

if you look at f'textures/{floor_text}.png 
you can see that Swamp 7 already expects your textures to be in the textures folder

the same goes for when specifying your ceiling texture

Now in terms of moving your ass
W A S D to move <- look left -> look right E move up Q move down or it's the other way around I don't know

and if you get this error: You must provide a floor and ceiling texture!

scrol down
 YOU
